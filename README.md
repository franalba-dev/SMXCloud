<h1 align="center">‚òÅÔ∏è SMXCloud</h1>

**SMXCloud** is a **web application** that allows you to **share documents** between teachers and students in an educational center in a **very simple** and **fast way**.
It also allows you as a teacher to manage these documents, create or delete users, create subjects...
SMXCloud uses **[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)** as the base for the project.

## üóíÔ∏è Notes
- In the futures days I will be uploading the code of the project and the guides that I made.
- I made this project as a part of my final grade project, but I didn't have enough time to make it as well as I wanted. So I will be updating this project with the time.
- Right now, you can see the code and try to use the application, but it isn't recommended to use it in a real environment until the version 3.0, that may be the last version.   
- If you have any new idea, I will appreciate a lot that you share it with me.
